# Prompts

# Invocation difference between agents and commands
I have claude agents @.claude/agents folder and claude commands @.claude/commands folder. I want to invoke agents and commands differently. For example, I want to invoke agents with @agent_name and commands with @command_name. How can I achieve this?
